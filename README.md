# Just-Wallpapers
Gave you Phone an Awesome Look with lots Free Wallpapers.

This is an open-source wallpaper app that I developed to learn to make a production-ready Android App. In this app, I used Kotlin language along with Dagger-Hilt, MVVM pattern, Coroutines, Room Library, Retrofit, In-app-updates, and View-Binding with the latest Android APIs.
